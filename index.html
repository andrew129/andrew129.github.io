        <div class='bio'>
            <p id='paragraph'>My name is Andrew Stiles, a 24 year old born in Bloomington, Indiana.  Throughout my life, I have lived in Apex, North Carolina for 12 years and now Florida for five years.  So far Florida is my favorite state and I plan on staying here as long as I possibly can.<br><br>I have had many career aspirations throughout my life.  When I was a kid, I loved dinosaurs and insects and wanted nothing more then to be a paleantologist when I grew up.  This cycle lasted for a few years and then I moved on and wanted to be a geologist.  Other aspirations I have had include: video game developer, professional soccer player, and most recently music producer or audio engineer.  As you can see I have a tendency to dream big.  After completing an internship as an audio engineer and having no luck finding a job, I decided to start at the UCF Coding Bootcamp while working part time at a restaurant.  Although it has been challenging, I have learned a lot so far.<br><br>Throughout my time in the coding bootcamp at UCF, I have developed skills in HTML, CSS and especially Javascript.  I have successfully learned how to incorporate interactivity to web pages in both the front end as well as the back end, by creating my own servers.  My greatest strengths are my ability to persevere even when a project gets tough and my strict attention to detail.  One of my greatest accomplishments was building a playable synthesizer using Javascript, JQuery, and the Tone.js api.  In addition to my skills in front and back end web development, I am also a musician and composer.  My music can be found by clicking the soundcloud link above.
